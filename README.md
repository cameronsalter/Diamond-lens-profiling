# Diamond lens profiling from cross-section
This Jupyter notebook extracts the profile of a solid-immersion lens (SIL) by analysing a cross-sectional image.

# Background
SILs were milled into a diamond substrate using focussed-ion beam (FIB) milling over point-defect which fluoresce. Information on the lens profile was required to optimise light collection efficiency. This information proved very difficult to get using AFM imaging due to high aspect ratios (lens radii ~ 1-2 um). The approach here uses FIB cross-sectioning to slice a lens in half - the lens profile can then be imaged using an electron microscope.
Work done ~2015 during post-doc at TU Wien.

# Methodology used in analysis:
Uses intensity contrast in cross-sectional image between a diamond lens and its platinum coating to determine boundary defining the lens shape.
